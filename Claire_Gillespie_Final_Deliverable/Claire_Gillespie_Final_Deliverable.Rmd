abstract: |
  Cannabis and tobacco are two of the most widely consumed narcotics globally and pose significant harms from smoke exposures, including chronic disease burden, drug addiction and/or cognitive impairment in vulnerable populations. Current methods that assess nicotine or cannabis dependence rely solely on standardized questionnaires that are prone to bias and misreporting. Thus, there is a need for an objective and non-invasive approach for the assessment of smoking status. Herein we introduce a high-throughput method for characterizing the salivary metabolome from a cohort of participants involved in a Trier Social Stress Test to examine how smoking and cannabis use affect cognition. Following a sample workup of diluted saliva filtrate, targeted profiling of the salivary metabolome was conducted using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis mass-spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) with full-scan data acquisition. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses of saliva samples will result in the identification of biomarkers associated with smoking status when comparing self-reported non-smokers (n=12), cannabis only (n=36), and cannabis-tobacco users (n=15). Temporal changes in the salivary metabolome will be explored by MSI-CE-MS prior to and following standardized psychosocial stress experiments among participants to identify biomarkers associated with cognitive dysfunction. This method will confirm recent exposure to other drugs of abuse that may confound behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and not captured by standardized questionnaires, including nicotine, opioids and benzodiazepenes. This research will elucidate the underlying mechanisms of stress intolerance among cannabis users while identifying salivary biomarkers associated with cannabis and tobacco dependence, including screening for concomitant use of other drugs prone to abuse.

# Background and Introduction

Cannabis and tobacco are among the top three most prevalent drugs used
globally, with 2.5% and 22.3% of the global population consuming
cannabis and tobacco in 2020.^1,2^ Cause for concern arises given
tobacco smoking remains the primary cause of preventable death in
Canada, with 17% of smoking related deaths being caused by cancers,
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.^3^ Moreover, smoking poses a
serious financial burden on the Canadian health care system, with the
total costs of tobacco use being \$16.2 billion in 2012.^4^ Furthermore,
cannabis has become the second most commonly used drug of abuse after
alcohol in Canada, notably among young adults. According to the 2021
Canadian cannabis survey, 37% and 49% of consumers are ages 16-19 and
20-24, respectively with 19% reporting the intake of marijuana on a
daily basis.^5^ With this rampant increase in cannabis use among young
Canadian adults, there is growing concern on the prevalence of cannabis
use disorder since it can contribute to addiction with deleterious
psychiatric effects that impair normal cognitive function.^6^
Specifically, prolonged, and frequent use of cannabis can alter brain
circuitry wherein individuals may experience distress intolerance
disorder, which is the inability to experience unpleasant, adverse, or
uncomfortable emotions.^7^ With both cannabis and tobacco use raising
concerns in terms of the physical and mental harms among vulnerable
populations, there is a need to determine the susceptibility an
individual may have in depending on these narcotics. However, current
methods for the assessment of nicotine or cannabis dependence rely
solely on standardized questionnaires that are prone to bias and
misreporting. Clinicians would thus benefit from a non-invasive yet
objective identification of cannabis and tobacco smoking status while
examining their putative harmful effects to better guide more
personalized therapeutic interventions.

In order for a clinician to determine the magnitude of dependence that
an individual may experience towards cannabis and/or tobacco, they
employ standardized tests such as the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine
Dependence (FTND) and the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test
(CUDIT). The FTND test encompasses 6 questions wherein the individual
must check off their smoking habits, with the sum of their answers
resulting in an FTND score. Dependence scores can range from 0-2 being
very low, 3-5 being medium and 6-10 being very high.^8^ Furthermore, the
CUDIT is a questionnaire with 8 total questions where the individuals
must rank their cannabis use habits, and their resulting sum CUDIT score
is subsequently tabulated. According to literature, individuals with
CUDIT scores of 12 and below have low cannabis dependence, whereas
individuals with CUDIT scores of 13 and above indicate a susceptibility
for cannabis use disorder with the recommendation of further
intervention.^9^ However, given that there are societal expectations
among the population, being that it is frowned upon to use drugs as a
coping mechanism, individuals may feel pressured to falsify their
answers to these standardized tests, resulting in lower FTND or CUDIT
scores than expected. Hence, there is a need for a biological
confirmation of the self-reported information to compliment the data
obtained by standardized questionnaires. Therefore, the goals of this
study was through the characterization of the salivary metabolome of
control, cannabis, and cannabis tobacco users, first confirm that
nicotine can be considered an exogenous biomarker of tobacco smoking
status, and second identify a marker that differentiates the sub-groups
based on smoking status while reflecting the harmful effects of habitual
cannabis and/or tobacco use. Finally, investigations on the mechanisms
of cannabis use disorder will be conducted through the analysis of
individuals from the cannabis only sub-group at baseline to determine
whether there is an underlying change among individuals with high versus
low CUDIT scores.

To determine an individual's metabolism, the salivary metabolome of the
participants was characterized. Metabolomics is an emerging field in
functional genomics which encompasses the analysis of low molecular
weight metabolites in complex biological samples using new advances in
high resolution mass spectrometry (MS).^10^ The human metabolome
comprises both endogenous and exogenous metabolites (including drugs of
abuse), which are influenced by both genetic factors and environmental
exposures.^11^ Previous research has proposed that the salivary
metabolome may provide unique insights into behavioral responses to
psychological stress using a non-invasive biofluid.^12^ Furthermore,
although untargeted salivary metabolomic studies have been applied to
identify novel biomarkers associated with cancer and oral health
studies,^10,13^ no report to date has examined its potential for
characterizing stress intolerance in high-risk individuals with cannabis
use disorder as compared to non-users or infrequent cannabis users not
prone to dependence. In this thesis, one will develop a robust protocol
for untargeted metabolite profiling from unstimulated saliva specimens
using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry
(MSI-CE-MS) as a high throughput method for biomarker discovery with
stringent quality control.^14,15^

Current methods for untargeted metabolite analysis include NMR and MS
coupled with chromatography, with the gold standard being LC-MS due to
its broad coverage of analytes with high efficiency separations, and
highly selective results.^16^ However, the limitations of these methods
involve the long processing times which are limited to low sample
throughput as well as the generated chromatograms may provide low
resolution peaks, making it difficult to identify metabolites as well as
the number of metabolites present in the data set.^17^ In contrast,
multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry
(MSI-CE-MS) utilizes a multiplexed separation platform for
metabolomics,^18^ allowing for higher sample throughput, improved
quality control and lower sample volume requirements.^19^ This method
employs an isocratic aqueous buffer with a coaxial sheath liquid
interface to provide a homogenous solution for electromigration and
ionization under steady state conditions,^14^ with customized serial
injections accelerating the potential for biomarker discovery and robust
inter-batch adjustment possible for use in large scale metabolomic
studies.^20^ Data acquisition using MSI-CE-MS first involves injecting
13 samples each separated by the same volume background electrolyte
(BGE) spacer into the capillary. The application of a voltage initiates
the flow of analytes from the injection site to the electrospray
ionization (ESI) source on the time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(TOF-MS). This gentle ionization source uses electrical energy to assist
the transfer of ions from solution to the gaseous phase through
protonation in positive mode and deprotonation in negative mode.^21^
Analytes are subsequently separated by their mass and charge using an
untargeted full-scan approach in the TOF-MS. A full-scan data
acquisition total ion electropherogram (TIE) is the result of one run in
MSI-CE-MS. From the TIE, one can extract the m/z of metabolites of
interest in a targeted manner, which generates extracted ion
electropherograms (EIE) for both positive and negative mode. Each EIE
should show thirteen peaks pertaining to the 13 injections from the
capillary. In order to confirm a metabolites identity, one can refer to
its mass spectrum, where a prominent molecular ion peak should be
present at the same mass to charge (m/z) as the metabolite, as well as a
less prominent C-13 peak approximately one mass unit away. Further
confirmation can be given when examining the mass resolution of the
metabolite of interest. Finally, MSI-CE-MS provides the ability to have
a quality control sample in each run, whose relative peak areas (RPAs)
are compared to monitor the performance of the platform and any
potential instrumental drift

## Floats

New float types are automatically set up by the class file. The means
graphics are included as follows (Scheme \ref{sch:example}). As
illustrated, the float is \`\`here'' if possible.

```{=tex}
\begin{scheme}
  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
  %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \caption{An example scheme}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='test'}
plot(1:10)
```

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
  As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
  and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
  \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
  \caption{An example figure}
  \label{fgr:example}
\end{figure}
```
Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
captioned. However, tables should always have a title. It is possible to
include a number and label for a graphic without any title, using an
empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption} macro.

The use of the different floating environments is not required, but it
is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In general,
you should place your graphics where they make logical sense; the
production process will move them if needed.

## Math(s)

The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
support for mathematics. If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
required, they should be loaded in the preamble. However, the basic
\LaTeX math(s) input should work correctly without this. Some inline
material $y = mx + c$ or $1 + 1 = 2$ followed by some display.
$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.
\ref{eqn:example}). \begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
\end{equation} This can also be used to have equations containing
graphical content. To align the equation number with the middle of the
graphic, rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
    \centering
    As illustrated here, the width of \\
    the minipage needs to allow some  \\
    space for the number to fit in to.
    %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \end{minipage}
  \label{eqn:graphic}
\end{equation}

# Experimental

The usual experimental details should appear here. This could include a
table, which can be referenced as Table \ref{tbl:example}. Notice that
the caption is positioned at the top of the table.

```{=tex}
\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one  & Header two  \\
    \hline
    Entry one   & Entry two   \\
    Entry three & Entry four  \\
    Entry five  & Entry five  \\
    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
Adding notes to tables can be complicated. Perhaps the easiest method is
to generate these using the basic
\texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and \texttt{\textbackslash emph}
macros, as illustrated (Table \ref{tbl:notes}).

```{=tex}
\begin{table}
  \caption{A table with notes}
  \label{tbl:notes}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one                            & Header two \\
    \hline
    Entry one\textsuperscript{\emph{a}}   & Entry two  \\
    Entry three\textsuperscript{\emph{b}} & Entry four \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \textsuperscript{\emph{a}} Some text;
  \textsuperscript{\emph{b}} Some more text.
\end{table}
```
The example file also loads the optional \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}}
gives \ce{H2SO4}. See the use in the bibliography file (when using
titles in the references section).

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process. For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example, to
give italic, mono-spaced text: \mycommand{some text}.

# Extra information when writing JACS Communications

When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the class
will automatically lay the text out in the style of the journal. This
gives a guide to the length of text that can be accommodated in such a
publication. There are some points to bear in mind when preparing a JACS
Communication in this way. The layout produced here is a \emph{model}
for the published result, and the outcome should be taken as a
\emph{guide} to the final length. The spacing and sizing of graphical
content is an area where there is some flexibility in the process. You
should not worry about the space before and after graphics, which is set
to give a guide to the published size. This is very dependant on the
final published layout.

You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
Communication and a normal article. For example, this demonstration file
will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are automatically
ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.
